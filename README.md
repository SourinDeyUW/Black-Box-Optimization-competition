# Black-Box-Optimization-competition

Got 26th position : Optimizer from Wyoming.

Things I did </br>
    1. Surrogate Modification: checking different surrogates, modifying GP kernels, initial design. </br>
    2. Sampling Strategy analysis: to check effect on performance of the optimizer. </br>
    3. Analyzing Acquisition Functions: tried to balance the exploration-exploitation trade-off. LCB showed better performance than PI, EI.
